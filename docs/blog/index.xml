      <description>sodifihdosdifhodi Negrito. Sem ser negrito.
One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
 He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
 The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.</description>

      <title>Use @ instead of HEAD</title>

      <description>I recently discovered that from git version 1.8.5 onwards, @ can replace HEAD:
$ git reset --hard @~2 $ git rebase -i @~10 $ git diff @~2..@~3  And also in most scenarios HEAD can be left out completely, so you can say:
$ git reset -- @{2}  instead of:
$ git reset -- HEAD@{2}  It takes some getting used to, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely faster than typing HEAD.</description>
